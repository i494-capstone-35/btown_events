",,Entertainment,,General: $45 - $68; Student: $33 - $58,"If there is one thing this renowned entertainer can do better than anyone else, it's talk at length, impromptu, before a live audience. Laughter and Reflection, Burnett's ""off-the-cuff"" banter with the audience, is a format that grew out of the question-and-answer sessions she shared with her studio audience on each episode of The Carol Burnett Show. As a weekly visitor in America's living rooms, Burnett always opened her show with a few minutes of hilarious banter with the audience. This is a rare opportunity to talk to Carol in the same enjoyable and intimate audience-interactive format."
